1. Project Title
Hotel Cancellation Prediction
2. Project Description
Start by giving a brief explanation of the project's purpose and the problem it solves. Hereâ€™s an example:

This project aims to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not using a machine learning model. The model is trained on historical data that includes customer booking details and hotel-related features. By accurately predicting cancellations, hotels can manage bookings better, reduce financial losses, and optimize resource allocation.
